Mixing extruder 

Definition
===============

A combination of exactly one nozzle with inputs 2 - 6 filaments driven by
their own filament driver build a mixing extruder. It is not required that this 
combination in deed mixes the colors. It could also be used to put only one
of the colors through the nozzle.

This combination gives us one real extruder that can in theory print many
different color combinations. Through the M163 command, it is possible to
change the mixing ratio at any time. Since slicers do not support this,
the firmware also introduces the concept of virtual extruders. The mixing
extruders can simulate 16 extruders (reachable over T0 until T15) with a preset
mixing ratio. The current mixing ratio can be stored as a virtual extruder
with the M164 command.

Configuration
=============

Set NUM_EXTRUDER to the number of filament drives. In addition set
MIXING_EXTRUDER to 1 in your Configuration.h. Now the steps per mm and
heater control settings are taken from extruder 0. The corresponding
settings in higher extruder numbers are ignored.


Theory
===========

All N extruders get a weight Wx and steps are executed to preserve the weights
in optimum number. Therefore each extruder has a error counter Ex which is
initalized with Wx and we also Compute the sum S of all weights.

Then for each extrusion step:
 Make step with highest value and subtract S from that value, then add Wx to Ex
 Extruders with weight 0 are not considered.

Example 1: 3 Extruders with weight 20 / 30 / 50

Step 1:  E1 = 20,  E2 = 30,  E3 = 50   => E3
Step 2:  E1 = 40,  E2 = 60,  E3 = 0    => E2
Step 3:  E1 = 60,  E2 = -10, E3 = 50   => E1
Step 4:  E1 = -20, E2 = 20,  E3 = 100  => E3
Step 5:  E1 = 0,   E2 = 50,  E3 = 50   => E2
Step 6:  E1 = 20,  E2 = -20, E3 = 100  => E3
Step 7:  E1 = 40,  E2 = 10,  E3 = 50   => E3
Step 8:  E1 = 60,  E2 = 40,  E3 = 0    => E1
Step 9:  E1 = -20, E2 = 70,  E3 = 50   => E2
Step 10: E1 = 0,   E2 = 0,   E3 = 100  => E3

Result: E1 = 2 steps, E2 = 3 steps, E5 = 5 steps 

Reverse stepping
----------------
Take the lowest error value of an extruder with weight > 0. Add S to that value.
Then subtract Wx to Ex for all.

Commands:
=============

M163 S<extruderNum> P<weight>  - Set weight for this mixing extruder drive

M164 S<0..15> - Save current mixing ratio as visrtual extruder S.
