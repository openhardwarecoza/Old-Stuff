A series of opensource furniture for our new shop we're moving into shortly but also great for you to make at home

Each of these have the following design requirements

1.  No advanced tooling needed - I'm a software and electronics oke, I don't own a table saw or a big wood CNC. So its critical to me that each design can be given to Citiwood, Builders, or Timbercity as a cut list that they can cut to size for me
2.  No advanced joints - if you have a biscuit jointer great, use it.  If all you own is a hammer and nails - no problem you can still assemble the design (add glue though).  Or anything in between:  screws, dowels, whatever you have will work.  Sure it may not all look as nice but for the purpose of this it does not matter - you can make it as quick/cheap or as pretty as you want/can
3.  Weekend project scale - quick and easy builds
4.  Low cost - single sheet plywood projects mostly (R400-800/ $40-80) 
5.  Pretty enough - some of these will be in public view next year - plus we have to look at it all day
6.  Open all the sources!
